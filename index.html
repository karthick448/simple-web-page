Full-stack development refers to the practice of working on both the front-end and back-end aspects of web applications. A full-stack developer is skilled in a variety of technologies and tools used to build and maintain websites or web apps. On the front-end, they work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular to create the user interface (UI) and ensure the application is visually appealing and functional. On the back-end, they deal with server-side logic, databases, and server management using languages like Node.js, Python, Ruby, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.

Full-stack developers are also responsible for integrating front-end and back-end components, ensuring the entire application functions seamlessly. This role requires versatility and a broad understanding of both client-side and server-side technologies, making full-stack developers highly sought after in the tech industry. Their ability to handle all layers of development makes them valuable for startups and larger companies alike.
